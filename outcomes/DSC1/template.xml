For each function <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> described below, 
make a sign chart for its first derivative. 
Use your sign chart to explain and

            <item><p>identify all <m>x</m> which are critical points;</p></item>
            <item><p>classify each critical point as a local (aka relative)

            <p>Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is the function whose derivative
            is depicted in the graph below (warning: this is NOT the graph
            of <m>f(x)</m>).</p>

The corresponding sign chart for the derivative is

            <p> Don't forget to use the sign chart to classify the 
            critical points as max / min / neither. Recall
            that a critical point is a max/min only if the first 
            derivative changes sign.

The derivative is <m mode = "display">g'(x) = {{f_prime}} </m>

            <p>Warning:  <m>x=0</m> <em>is</em> a critical point, 
            and there is an unlabeled tickmark at <m>x=0</m> 
            in the automatically generated sign chart.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to use the sign chart to classify the 
            critical points as max / min / neither. 
            Recall that a critical point is a max/min only 
            if the first derivative changes sign.</p>
