For each of function <m>f(x)</m> below, make a sign chart 
for its first derivative. Use your sign chart to explain and  
        </p>
        <list>
            <item><p>identify all <m>x</m> which are critical points;</p></item>
            <item><p>classify each critical point as a local (aka relative)
            maximum or minimum (or neither).</p></item>

            <p>Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is the function whose derivative
            is depicted in the graph below.</p>

        <outtro>
            <p>
The corresponding sign chart for the derivative is

            <p><image

            /></p>
            <p> Recall that the critical points are exactly the 
            tickmarks for the first derivative sign chart. Further, recall
            that a critical point is a max/min only if the first 
            derivative changes sign.
            </p>
            <p>Warning: unless <m>x=0</m> is a critical point, 
            you may ignore any unlabeled tickmark at <m>x=0</m> 
            in the automatically generated sign chart.

The derivative is <m mode = "display">f'(x) = {{f_prime}} </m> 
and the corresponding sign chart for the derivative is 
            </p>
            <p><image

            /></p>
            <p>
Warning:  <m>x=0</m> <em>is</em> a critical point, 
and there is an unlabeled tickmark at <m>x=0</m> 
in the automatically generated sign chart.

Recall that a critical point is a max/min only 
if the first derivative changes sign.
