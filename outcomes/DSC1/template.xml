        <p>
For each function <m>f(x)</m> described below, 
make a sign chart for its first derivative <m>f'(x)</m>. 
Use your sign chart to explain and
        </p>
        <list>
            <item><p>identify all <m>x</m> which are critical points 
            for <m>f(x)</m>;</p></item>
            <item><p>classify each critical point as a local (aka relative)
            maximum or minimum (or neither) for <m>f(x)</m>.</p></item>

            <p>The graph below depicts the DERIVATIVE of some unknown
            function <m>f(x)</m>. Warning: i.e., this is NOT the graph
            of <m>f(x)</m>, but the graph of <m>f'(x)</m>.</p>

            <p> Don't forget to use the sign chart to classify the 
            critical points as max / min / neither. Recall
            that a critical point is a max/min only if the first 
            derivative changes sign.

            <p>Warning:  <m>x=0</m> <em>is</em> a critical point, 
            and there is an unlabeled tickmark at <m>x=0</m> 
            in the automatically generated sign chart.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to use the sign chart to classify the 
            critical points as max / min / neither. 
            Recall that a critical point is a max/min only 
            if the first derivative changes sign.</p>
