        <p>
For each of the functions below, make a sign chart 
for its second derivative and use it to
        </p>
        <list>
            <item><p>find the intervals where the function
            is concave up / down 
            (give your answer in interval notation);</p></item>
            <item><p>find all points of inflection for the function.</p></item>
        </list>

The second derivative is <m mode = "display">p''(x) = {{p_2prime}} </m> 
and the corresponding sign chart for the derivative is
            </p>

            /></p>
            <p>
Warning: There is an unlabeled tickmark at <m>x=0</m> 
in the automatically generated sign chart. This is an 
artifact of the computer code generating the diagram and 
occurs whether or not <m>p''(0) = 0 </m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Recall that an inflection point occurs at <m>x=a</m> only when the 
second derivative changes sign at <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=a</m> is in 
the domain of the original function <m>p(x)</m>.
