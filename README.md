# Differential Calculus of Algebraic Functions (DiffCalc_Alg)

This is a bank of randomized exercises for the CheckIt platform. The exercises align with 12 learning outcomes for differential calculus involving algebraic functions. 

The exercises were developed originally for the first semester of a year-long "Calculus I with Integrated Precalculus" sequence at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC [<https://math.wfu.edu/>]. In particular, this bank is intended to pair with the precalculus skills bank PreCalcSkills1 which can be found at <https://allmanjm.github.io/pre-calc-1/>. At the end of this document, there is a list of how the PreCalcSkills1 outcomes align with the outcomes in this bank.

## Learning Outcomes for Differential Calculus of Algebraic Functions

### L. Limits (3 standards)

###### LNIF. I can evaluate limits for which the initial form is not an *indeterminate form*.

###### LIF1. I can evaluate limits for which the initial form is an *indeterminate form*. I can use factoring and canceling to compute the limit when $x\to a$ for a finite number $a$.

###### LIF2. I can evaluate limits for which the initial form is an *indeterminate form*. I can use algebraic methods or comparison of degrees to compute the limit when $x \to \pm\infty$.

### D. Rates of change and derivatives (9 standards)

###### DARC. I can compute the *average rate of change* of a function on a given interval. Additionally, I can depict the average rate of change as the slope of a secant line.

###### DDfn. I can use the definition of the derivative as a limit to compute derivatives of $x^n$ for $n = 2$, $3$, $4$, or $-1$.

###### DIAR. I can identify which differentiation rule(s) need to be applied (in order); moreover, I can apply the rules to compute the derivative.

###### DLin. I can compute the *linearization* of $f(x)$ near $x=a$ and interpret it with a picture.

###### DLAE. I can use linear approximation to perform estimations without a calculator. In particular, I can estimate real $n$-th roots for $n = 2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$.

###### DCrP. I can find the critical points of a function.

###### DSC1. I can make a *sign chart* for the first derivative and use it to (1) find where a function is increasing/decreasing, and (2) classify *critical points*. In other words, I can perform a **first derivative test**.

###### DSC2. I can make a *sign chart* for the second derivative and use it to (1) find where a function is concave up/down, and (2) locate points of inflection.

###### DGrS. I can sketch accurate graphs of functions $y=f(x)$ by using (1) information from the three sign charts for $f$, $f’$, and $f’’$ together with (2) information about the two limits of $f$ as $x\to\pm\infty$.
