            <description>
I can evaluate limits for which the initial form is an *indeterminate form*.
I can use factoring and canceling to compute the limit when $x\to a$ for a
finite number $a$.

I can use algebraic methods or comparison of degrees to compute the limit 
when $x \to \pm\infty$.

            <description>
I can compute the *average rate of change* of a function
on a given interval. Additionally, I can depict the average
rate of change as the slope of a secant line.

            <description>
I can use the definition of the derivative
as a limit to compute derivatives of $x^n$ 
for $n = 2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$.

            <path>outcomes/DIAR</path>
            <description>
I can identify which differentiation rule(s) need to be applied (in order); 
moreover, I can apply the rules to compute the derivative.

            <description>
I can use linear approximation to perform estimations without a
calculator. In particular, I can estimate real $n$-th roots for
$n = 2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$.

            <description>
I can make a *sign chart* for the first derivative and use it to
(1) find where a function is increasing/decreasing, and 
(2) classify *critical points*.
In other words, I can perform a **first derivative test**.

I can make a *sign chart* for the second derivative and use it to
(1) find where a function is concave up/down, and 
(2) locate points of inflection.
